# Roadmap

What's planned for app-store-toolkit. No promises on timelines.

## In Progress

- [ ] End-to-end testing with live App Store Connect accounts
- [ ] Error messages and edge case handling across all MCP tools

## Next Up

- [ ] Screenshot text overlay generation per locale
- [ ] A/B testing support for metadata variants
- [ ] ASO keyword ranking tracker (track positions over time)
- [ ] Metadata templates (save and reuse generation patterns)
- [ ] CI/CD integration (validate metadata in pull requests)

## Later

- [ ] Multi-app workspace (manage several apps from one repo)
- [ ] Fastlane metadata migration (`fastlane deliver` format import/export)
- [ ] App Store version submission workflow (create version, attach build, submit for review)
- [ ] Conversion rate analytics (pull download and impression data)
- [ ] Custom field plugins (extend metadata schema for internal use)

## Ideas (Not Committed)

- Automatic promo art generation with AI
- Competitor keyword gap analysis
- Review sentiment trends over time
- Slack/webhook notifications on metadata sync
